Break the ice  
A piece of cake  
Under the weather  
Hit the nail on the head  
Once in a blue moon  
Let the cat out of the bag  
Spill the beans  
The ball is in your court  
Time flies when you're having fun  
Curiosity killed the cat  
Every cloud has a silver lining  
When pigs fly  
Jump on the bandwagon  
It takes two to tango  
Back to square one  
Kill two birds with one stone  
Don't cry over spilled milk  
A blessing in disguise  
Burn the midnight oil  
Bite the bullet  
Hit the books  
Call it a day  
Let sleeping dogs lie  
Kick the bucket  
Go the extra mile  
Take it with a grain of salt  
Actions speak louder than words  
Barking up the wrong tree  
Cost an arm and a leg  
Cry wolf  
Get cold feet  
Go down in flames  
In hot water  
Keep your chin up  
Lay it on thick  
Off the beaten path  
On thin ice  
Put all your eggs in one basket  
Raining cats and dogs  
Skeleton in the closet  
Steal someone's thunder  
The elephant in the room  
Through thick and thin  
Twist someone's arm  
Up in the air  
Water under the bridge  
Wear your heart on your sleeve  
You can't judge a book by its cover  
A drop in the ocean  
All bark and no bite  
At the drop of a hat  
Between a rock and a hard place  
Cat got your tongue  
Devil's advocate  
Down to earth  
Face the music  
For crying out loud  
Get out of hand  
Hands are tied  
In the blink of an eye  
Jack of all trades  
Keep your eyes peeled  
Light at the end of the tunnel  
Make a long story short  
No pain no gain  
Out of the frying pan into the fire  
Piece of the pie  
Rock the boat  
See eye to eye  
Speak of the devil  
Stick to your guns  
Take the bull by the horns  
The early bird catches the worm  
The last straw  
Throw in the towel  
Turn a blind eye  
Wipe the slate clean  
A wild goose chase  
Better late than never  
Caught red-handed  
Don't put off until tomorrow  
Easier said than done  
Fish out of water  
Go back to the drawing board  
If it ain't broke don't fix it  
Just what the doctor ordered  
Keep it under wraps  
Lend a helping hand  
Make ends meet  
Nip it in the bud  
Out of the blue  
Put your money where your mouth is  
Rome wasn't built in a day  
Save it for a rainy day  
Take it or leave it  
The pot calling the kettle black  
Think outside the box  
Turn over a new leaf  
Where there's smoke there's fire  
You scratch my back I'll scratch yours
